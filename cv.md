>I'm burned out

After this asked, I was able finally quit my job.
I started study in "School 21". However, I couldn't get into school.
In March 2021 I was invited to work with POS-terminals.
"A good start" - I said. Afterwords I bought Front-end development course.
One year I was learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have completed
Front-end development course in Innopolis University.

And now, I'm learning React.js and Next.js with TypeScript.
My history isn't to finish, this description my work experience will be to update.

```javascript
function myLearnToJob(hands, laptops) {
  if (hands < 0) {
    return alert("Use your foots")
  } else if (laptops < 0) {
    return alert("Create mine laptop")
  } else alert("Halt and Catch Fire")
}

myLearnToJob(2, 2)
```
